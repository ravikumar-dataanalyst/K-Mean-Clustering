# K-Mean-Clustering
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The algorithm aims to group similar data points into the same cluster while keeping dissimilar points in different clusters. K-means clustering is widely used in various fields, such as data analysis, pattern recognition, and image segmentation.

Here's a brief introduction to the key concepts of K-means clustering:

1. **Objective:**
   - The main goal of K-means clustering is to minimize the sum of squared distances (Euclidean distances) between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - **Initialization:** Randomly select K data points as initial centroids.
   - **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the cluster whose centroid is the closest (based on Euclidean distance).
   - **Update Centroids:** Recalculate the centroids of the clusters based on the mean of data points in each cluster.
   - **Repeat Assignment and Update:** Iteratively repeat the assignment and centroid update steps until convergence or a specified number of iterations.

3. **Number of Clusters (K):**
   - One of the challenges in applying K-means is determining the appropriate number of clusters (K). Common methods for choosing K include the elbow method and silhouette analysis.

4. **Centroids:**
   - Centroids represent the center of each cluster. They are calculated as the mean of the data points in the respective clusters.

5. **Euclidean Distance:**
   - The distance between two points in space. In K-means, it is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between a data point and a centroid.

6. **Convergence:**
   - The algorithm converges when there is little or no change in the assignment of data points to clusters or the centroids after an iteration.

7. **Applications:**
   - K-means clustering is used in various applications, such as customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.

8. **Considerations:**
   - K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids. Multiple runs with different initializations can be performed, and the best result can be selected.
   - It assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized, which may not always be true in real-world datasets.
